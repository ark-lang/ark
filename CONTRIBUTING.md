# Contributing
We'd love your contributions to make Alloy a better programming language.

## Code Style

* CamelCase, not snake_things_like_this
* Indent with **four** spaces
* Provide spaces around operators for readability, i.e (1 + 1), over (1+1)
* Use a space after a colon, not before

## Community
Having any problems? [Open an Issue](https://github.com/alloy-lang/alloy/issues). 

### IRC
There is also an IRC room over on freenode: [#alloy-lang](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23alloy-lang), here's the info if you want to enter it into your own client:

* ip: `irc.freenode.net`
* channel: `#alloy-lang`

### Subreddit
We also have a subreddit, [here's the link](http://www.reddit.com/r/alloy_lang).

### Mailing List
We have no idea how this works, but apparently we should have one, [so here it is](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/alloy-lang).

It's recommended that you open an issue than head over to the IRC since we rarely go there given our tight schedules. Issues will however be responded to ASAP. 

## Pull Requests
Please ensure that you rebase your commits against remote master prior to submitting a pull request, in order to prevent edit collisions. Pull Requests will be reviewed by the contributors, and other members of the community.

## Proposing a feature or change
If you want to have a say in the language, feel free to
[open an issue](https://github.com/alloy-lang/alloy/issues). We use proposals
so that people can vote on the idea, since the smallest change can put Alloy
in a completely different direction. To help us all out, please include
the following when submitting your issue:

> Title: [Feature/Change] Proposal Summary
> =====================================
>
> Contents:
>
> 1. Your proposition, described with as much detail as possible.
> 2. Why time and work should be put into developing out this feature.
> 3. An(y) example(s) of how your proposition would work/be used.
> 4. Any additonal data.

Please ensure that you check back on the issue often and actively participate
in the ensuing discussion until a consensus is reached.
