# Jayfor
Jayfor is a WIP programming language written in C. We aim to write
Jayfor from the ground up, that means no lexer generators, or parser
generators. While we are at a disadvantage that it will take longer
to create a working programming language, we will have full control
over the language, and also when we bootstrap Jayfor - it will be
easier to do.
