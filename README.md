We have an IRC channel, this is mostly where we discuss development related
issues, syntax styles, and so on. Interested in contributing, come over
to our IRC channel:

    server:     irc.freenode.net

    channel:    ##jayfor

Since there aren't many of us, we're mostly active around 4pm GMT on weekdays.

# <a name="about"></a>About
Jayfor is a programming language written in C. It is still under
heavy development. Jayfor is influenced from languages like Rust,
C, C++, and Java. We like to keep things simple, safe and fast,
but maintain a syntactically beautiful language.
You can view the snippet of code below for a basic 'feel' of the language,
or check out some actual code we use for the library [here](libs/math.j4).

    // this is no longer a test for while loops
    // just some random code for testing

    int a = (5 + 5)
    int z = a
    int a
    char b = 'a'

    fn add(int a, int b): int {
        ret (a + b)
    }

    fn test(int a, int b, str x): <int, float, str> {
        for int x:(10, 0) {
            add(a, b)
        }

        ret <a, 3.2, "test">
    }

    fn main(int a, int b): void {
        test(5, 5, "rand")
    }
