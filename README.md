## Building
Disclaimer: This project is constantly in development and is still a work in progress, we are still a long way away from getting everything to work somewhat smoothly, so if it breaks or doesn't build, sorry!
To build you will need:

 - Make 3(.81???)
 - A suitable GNU C compiler (any one of the below will do fine, we aren't sure about other C compilers quite yet):
   - [`clang >= 3.4.0`](http://llvm.org/releases/download.html)
   - [`gcc >= 4.8.1`](https://gcc.gnu.org/) (change `C` in the [makefile](/Makefile) to `gcc`

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone -v https://github.com/felixangell/alloy.git
    
# cd into the repository
cd alloy

# build
make
```
