# <a name="about"></a>About
Jayfor is a programming language written in C. It is still under
heavy development. Jayfor is influenced from languages like Rust,
C, C++, and Java. We like to keep things simple, safe and fast,
but maintain a syntactically beautiful language.
You can view the snippet of code below for a basic 'feel' of the language,
or check out some actual code we use for the library [here](libs/math.j4).

	// add the given values together
	fn add(int a = 0, int b = ((5 + 5) - (5 + 5))) [int] {
		ret (a + b);
	}

	fn main(): [void] {
		int a = add(5, 3);
		println(a);
	}

# <a name="note"></a>Note
JAYFOR is still in design stage. It's not quite working yet, stay tuned.
