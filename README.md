# [Alloy](http://alloy-lang.org) [![BuildStatus](https://travis-ci.org/alloy-lang/alloy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alloy-lang/alloy)
Alloy is a work in progress programming language, read the [reference](docs/REFERENCE.md) to find out more about the plans, syntax, etc. Please note that the language is constantly being changed, so the Reference may be outdated, or a little bit behind the master.

## Disclaimer?
Alloy is a somewhat experimental language, this means it can and probably will change at any point, be it a small change, or a complete re-write. This means we cannot promise any backwards compatibility. 

## Building
Alloy is a work in progress, if you would like to contribute to the creation of the language, or just give it a go, you will
need a few things:

* GCC/Clang, other compilers may work
* Make

```bash
$ git clone http://www.github.com/alloy-lang/alloy
$ cd alloy
$ make
```

After you make the project, the alloyc executable will be located in `bin/alloyc`. For a list of commands,
run the `-h` flag. There are test files under the `tests/` directory, however the one in the example may not exist
if you are reading this in the future! We also can't guarantee that it will still work either!

```bash
bin/alloyc tests/factorial.ay
./main
```

## Community
If you are looking for some help, want to ask a question, or just want to talk to us for whatever reason, we have a few
places where you can find us.

### Subreddit
We have a subreddit, this is mostly to get it before someone else does, but a lot of the developers are active Redditors. So feel
free to ask questions on there, etc.

### Mailing List
We have no idea how this works, but apparently we should have one. You can find it here:
[Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/alloy-lang)

### IRC
We have an IRC where we discuss Alloy features, problems, and other stuff too. Come join! If you want to help contribute,
we highly suggest you join the IRC, the majority of the core developers will be active here, although we might not always be available due to time zone differences.
