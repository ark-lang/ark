# [Alloy](http://alloy-lang.org) [![BuildStatus](https://travis-ci.org/alloy-lang/alloy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alloy-lang/alloy)
Alloy is a work in progress programming language, read the [reference](docs/REFERENCE.md) to find out more about the plans, syntax, etc. Please note that the language is constantly being changed, so the Reference may be outdated, or a little bit behind the master.

## Disclaimer?
Alloy is a somewhat experimental language, this means it can and probably will change at any point, be it a small change, or a complete re-write. This means we cannot promise any backwards compatibility. 

## Just show me what it looks like already
Sure, you can either see a small virtual machine implemented in Alloy [here](tests/misc/virtualmachine.ay). Or you can just see a small snippet below:

    fn main(): int {
        println("Hello, World");
    }

## I am interested in programming with Alloy
Alloy isn't quite ready yet! We're still patching up bugs, implementing features, and writing documentation. You can still clone the repository, build it, and hope that it works. Although, it is still under development, which means that it can break at any point. In the mean time, you can help us with Alloy, or check out the various documentation in the [docs folder](/docs).

## I am looking to contribute to Alloy
If you're interested in helping us improve Alloy, that's great! You can either skip straight on to the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file, or you can see what category you fall under. Even if you know what you're doing, we recommend you read the below, just so you are aware of other ways that you can help contribute to Alloy.

### I have little experience in programming
Since the compiler is in it's *very* early stages, there is bound to be a lot of bugs and errors littered around, you can either try and patch these up, or report them to the [issue handler](https://github.com/alloy-lang/alloy/issues).

### I'm new to programming compilers
That's not a problem. In the [issue handler](https://github.com/alloy-lang/alloy/issues). there are issues marked with their "grading" on how difficult they are. If you're just starting out, try the `easy` issues, if you're feeling more confident, then you can give the `intermediate` issues a try. If you're feeling really confident, you can try the `hard` issues. We also suggest that you read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

### I'm an expert in programming compilers
Brilliant, you can either try and close issues, implement features, fix bugs, or submit proposals for the language. If we notice that you're a fairly regular contributor, we will consider adding you to the contributors team so you have write access to the repositories.

### I'm an expert in the design of compilers
Great, we could use your voice in the issues. Give us your opinion on proposals, and other issues posted.

### I am a hobbyist/professional web developer
Awesome, we have the source code for the [website](http://www.alloy-lang.org) published under our organization [here](https://github.com/alloy-lang/alloy-lang.org). Feel free to contribute, fix grammatical errors, styles, etc. and send us a pull request!
