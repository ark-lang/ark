### ALERT: **We changed the name from Jayfor to Ink. Its the same project, just a different name. [Here's why.](https://github.com/ink-lang/ink/issues/68)**

# <a href="http://ink-lang.github.io">Ink</a> - [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ink-lang/ink.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ink-lang/ink)
Ink is a programming language written in C. The goals of this language are:

* Speed
* Simplicity
* Clean

## NOTE TO ALL THOSE INTERESTED/LURKERS
Ink started off and will, for the moment, **be an educational project**. We'd love to see it go mainstream, but, as it stands, there are a lot of stable languages already out there. Its a tough challenge. So, for all those asking how good is this language/will this language be when compared to Go or Rust or *insert language here*, we want to clarify (again) that this project was in no manner started for the sole purpose of competing with languages already out there. Those that are interested in the project and like the idea are more than welcome to contribute to its growth (into something big). Being in a tender stage of development, we still have a lot of features that we want to implement. But a majority of the suggestions come from **you**. So please don't hesitate to propose a change to the language, following the instructions mentioned somewhere below. Please do not expect too much from the language (at least not right now). Our priority is to get the language to a stage where it can compute and produce results. Any thoughts about competition or stance when compared to other languages **is the least of our priorities right now**. 

## Why?
We created Ink because we love writing C, and love the simplicity of C; we also wanted to evolve C
into something more modern, and easier to use.

## Status
* The language is still in development. More information/specifics can be found in the `misc/` folder
* The compiler is written in C
* LLVM is used for the backend

## Contributing
### Community
The IRC will be up soon.

### Pull Requests
All pull requests are welcome:

* Fork the project
* Clone the repository from your account `git clone git@github.com:your_user/ink.git`
* Create your branch for the fix `git checkout -b ink-toast-fix`
* Make your changes
* Submit a Pull Request
* **IMPORTANT** Please rebase on master everytime before you push to check for conflicts

### Proposing a feature/change
If you want to have a say in the language, feel free to post an Issue in the [Issue Handler](https://github.com/ink-lang/ink/issues). We
use proposals so that people can vote on the idea, since the smallest change can put Ink in a completely
different direction. To help out the developers, please include the following in your Issue:

    Title:
    [PROPOSAL] - Proposal Summary.

    Contents:
    * What you are proposing
    * Why you think it's a good idea
    * If it's a syntax related proposal, post any ideas of syntax you can. This isn't mandatory, but will help.

## Building
To build you will need **LLVM 3.4 or above**, and **clang**. If you don't have clang,
you can change the [Makefile](Makefile) to use **GCC** or another compiler. Open your
terminal and run the following:

    # clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/ink-lang/ink.git
    
    # cd into the repository
    cd ink

    # build
    make

    # run a program
    ./inkc tests/simple.ink

If something doesn't work, feel free to post in the [Issues Handler](https://github.com/ink-lang/ink/issues).
