## Building
To build you will need:

 - [`LLVM >= 3.4`](http://llvm.org/releases/download.html)
 - A suitable GNU C compiler (any one of the below will do fine):
   - [`clang >= 3.4.0`](http://llvm.org/releases/download.html)
   - [`gcc >= 4.8.1`](https://gcc.gnu.org/) (change `LCC` and 
     `LCXX` in the [makefile](/Makefile) to `gcc` and `g++`, respectively)

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone -v https://github.com/alloy-lang/alloy.git
    
# cd into the repository
cd alloy

# build
make

# run a program
cd tests

# run the test bash script
# if some of these fail, it might be because
# the developers have changed the document
./alloyctest.sh
```
