# [Alloy](http://alloy-lang.org) [![BuildStatus](https://travis-ci.org/alloy-lang/alloy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alloy-lang/alloy)
Alloy is a work in progress programming language, read the [reference](docs/REFERENCE.md) to find out more about the plans, syntax, etc. Please note that the language is constantly being changed, so the Reference may be out-dated, or a little bit behind the master.

## Disclaimer?
Alloy is a somewhat experimental language, this means it can and probably will change at any point, be it a small change, or a complete re-write. This means we cannot promise any backwards compatibility. 

## Trello
We have a [Trello](https://trello.com/b/CEIhYFlr/alloy-lang), which is used by the core
developers of Alloy, but you can check it out to see what we're working on, fixing, or 
doing currently. Note that this doesn't replace the Issue Tracker, we just use it as we prefer
the layout.

## Status
Alloy is still constantly being worked on. At the moment it compiles,
however some aspects of the language are unimplemented or broken.

## Just show me what it looks like already
Sure, you can either see a small virtual machine implemented in Alloy [here](tests/misc/virtualmachine.aly). Or you can just see a small Hello World example below:

```rust
use "stdio"

fn main(): int {
    println("Hello, World");
    return 0;
}
```

## How can I help out with Alloy?
There are loads of ways you can help out:

* Sending PR's (features, bug fixes, etc)
* Commenting on issues
* Creating issues (proposals, bugs, etc)
* Writing documentation
