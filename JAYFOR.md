# JAYFOR
JAYFOR is a compiled programming language

## Frontend
The frontend of JAYFOR is fairly simple, we use a hand written Lexer and Parser. 

### Why a hand written Lexer/Parser?
* I've never used a lexer/parser generator 
* I like writing things from scratch
* Fun
* Learning more about lexers/parsers
* Tailoring the lexer/parser specifically to the J4 language
* Less bloat

## Backend
We don't know yet.
