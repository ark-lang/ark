# Alloy Reference
This is a reference for the Alloy programming language. Please note that the language is in constant development,
therefore this reference can become outdated at any time, and it can be days before it is updated to the current stage
of the compiler.

## Introduction
The aim of this compiler is to reinvent C. We love C, it's simple, fast, expressive, and cross-platform. However, it
has it's flaws:

* buffer overflows
* no string type
* no booleans without stdbool
* 30 years old
* inconsistencies, especially in error handling

Our goal with Alloy is to fix these errors, yet maintaining a cleaner, simpler syntax.
A lot of the syntax for Alloy is inspired by existing languages, such as Rust, Go, and Java. The language itself is
also heavily inspired by the simplicity of C. We don't want to add too much that it constrains the developer to a single paradigm.

## Memory Model
The memory model is still undecided, we are either going for a no garbage collection, C style memory model. Or we adopt the ARC
model, where the compiler detects where the allocated memory goes out of scope and deallocates it. We also wanted to simplify memory allocations
with the `new` and `delete` keywords, similar to C++.

## Syntax

### Semi-colons
Semi-colons are enforced in the Alloy programming language.

### Variables
#### Variable Definitions
Variable definitions are as follows:

	[type] [name];
	
For example:

	int i;
	double d;
	float f;
	bool b;
	structure_name s;

#### Variable Declarations
Variable declarations are as follows:

	[type] [name] = [expression];
	
For example:

	int x = 5;
	double d = 10.0;
	float f = 3.21;
	bool b = false;

### Functions
Function are defined as follows:

	// multiple statements
	fn [function_name]([type] [name], ...):[return_type] {
		[statements];
	}
	
	// or
	
	// single statement afterwards
	fn [function_name]([type] [name], ...):[return_type] -> [statement];

For example:

	fn do_stuff(int a): void {
		a = 5;
		global_variable = a + 2;
	}
	
	fn add(int a, int b): int -> return a + b;
	
#### Function Redirect
A function redirect is where you direct the return value from the function into a variable, for example:

	fn add(int a, int b): int -> return a + b;
	
	fn main(): void {
		int x;
		add(5, 5) -> x;
	}

The syntax is as follows:

	[function_call] -> [variable];
	
The variable must be defined.
