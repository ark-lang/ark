# Alloy Reference
This is a reference for the Alloy programming language. Please note that the language is in constant development,
therefore this reference can become outdated at any time, and it can be days before it is updated to the current stage
of the compiler.

## Introduction
The aim of this compiler is to reinvent C. We love C, it's simple, fast, expressive, and cross-platform. However, it
has it's flaws:

* buffer overflows
* no string type
* no booleans without stdbool
* 30 years old
* inconsistencies, especially in error handling

Our goal is to fix the aforementioned errors, and add a hint of modern.
