* Possibly rename stdio to just io
* Possibly rename stdlib to std
* It seems like a good idea to rename the functions later on so they are more consistent, once more conventions for Ark are established. For example, remove() could be renamed to * emoveFile(), because remove() is an inspecific function name clogging up the global namespace.
* Speaking of namespaces, should a module/namespace system be implemented?
