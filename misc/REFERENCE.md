* Statically Typed
* ARC memory model
* Dynamic Memory Allocation, although we might try do Rust's lifetime thing
* Statically Linked

# <a name="memorymodel"></a>Memory Model
Jayfor will use an Objective-C-like memory model, namely **reference counting**.
Reference counting is (what we think) a really efficient method to handle memory.
How it works is, every time memory is allocated, say for a structure in this
case, the program will hold a reference to that structure and "increment its
value by 1": which is to say it will make a valid reference to an instance of
that structure (as instantiated by you) in memory.
As more and more structures are added (or any other data structure/variable
for that matter), there will be individual references made to it,
which, when determined [by the program] to be useless, causes the reference to
be "decremented" so to speak, and the structure is eliminated from memory.

However, for those moments where you require the memory to be manually managed (which can
be necessary in certain situations), we have included the `unsafe` keyword,
which when used on a pointer, **requires you to manually deallocate the said memory using the
`dealloc` function**.

Example:

	enum DoorType {
		SCISSOR,
		SUICIDE,
		BUTTERFLY
	}

    struct Car {
        str door_type
        int license_plate_number
    }

    unsafe Car ^mclaren = alloc(sizeof(^mclaren))
	mclaren.door_type = DoorType::SCISSOR
    mclaren.license_plate_number = 2048

    // do something with aforementioned structure

    // deallocate the @{mclaren} instance  
    dealloc(mclaren)

# <a name="pointers"></a>Pointers
Pointers are denoted with a `^`. We chose this over the traditional `*` because it's a lot easier to parse,
and also clearer to see in expressions, for example:

	// C example
	int y = 10;
	int *d = &y;
	int x = 5 * *d;

	// Jayfor
	int y = 10
	int ^d = &y
	int x = 5 * ^d

# <a name="preprocessor"></a>Pre-processor
Jayfor will be statically linked, *we're still yet to create a pre-processor*,
but you would use the `use` pre-processor directive to include a file, like so:

	use stdio

Will use the standard input output library, which means you can call functions
like `println`.

# <a name="lexandparse"></a>Lexer/Parser Structure
## <a name="comments"></a>Comments
Comments in Jayfor code follow the general C style of line and block comments. Nested
comments are supported.
Line comments begin with exactly two forward slashes, and block comments begin with
exactly one forward slash and repeated asterisks, and are closed with exactly one asterisks
and one forward slash:

	/*
		This is a block comment.
	 */

## <a name="keywords"></a>Keywords

	int 		bool		float		str 		void
	enum		struct 		return 		const 		true
	false 		match 		while 		for 		do
	if 			else 		unsafe 		fn  		char	
	break		continue

## <a name="expressions"></a>Expressions
The following arithmetic operations are currently supported:

	+	-	/	*	%

Jayfor does not have operator precedence parsing as of writing this document, this is subject
to change, but for now expressions precedence must be explicitly defined with brackets `()`.
For example:

	5 + 5 / 10 * 2

Would be expressed as:

	((5 + 5) / (10 * 2))

## <a name="functions"></a>Functions
A function defines a sequence of statements, and an *optional* final expression,
along with a name and a set of parameters. Functions are declared with the keyword `fn`.
Functions declare a set of parameters, which the called passed arguments to the function, and
the function passes the results back to the caller.

A function must also have a return type, which defines what value the function will return to
the caller. This is specified after the colon operator, like so:

	fn add(int a, int b): int {
		return (a + b)
	}

### <a name="single_line_functions"></a>Single Line Functions
If a function only has one return statement, you may simplify it with the `=>` operator. For
example, a function that adds two integers can be simplified to:

	fn add(int a, int b): int => return (a + b)

### <a name="unsafe_functions"></a>Unsafe Functions
If a function is later on deemed unsafe, you may use the `unsafe` keyword to give a compile
time warning if an unsafe warning were to be called, i.e:

	unsafe fn allocate_memory(int size): void {
		// some dangerous memory allocation
		// some old code that was demmed dangerous
		// whatever
	}

If a developer were to call this function, a warning would be printed to the console on compile
time:

	""filename.j4":5:5: warning: use of unsafe function 'allocate_memory'!"

## <a name="single_line_blocks"></a>Single Line Blocks
To make single line blocks more clear to see, we've decided on using `=>` as a shorthand for any block
statements, this is supported in most cases, except for the following, which are handled differently:

* enumerations
* structures
* match

We feel like this is a nice syntactic sugar for small functions, however it can be used in the following (with examples):

### Functions

	fn add(int a, int b): int => return (a + b)

### While Loops

	while true => something = (something + 1)

### Infinite Loops

	loop => something = (something + 1)

### For Loops

	for _:(0, 10) => something = (something + 1)

### If Statements

	if (a == 2) => return (a - 1)

They can also be nested, e.g:

	fn do_stuff(int a, int b): int => while (a >= 20) => something = (something + 1)

However this can get messy pretty quickly, so we suggest formatting like so:

	fn add(int a, int b): int 
		=> while true 
			=> if (a > b) 
				=> return (a + b)

And another formatting suggestion:

	fn add(int a, int b): int 
		=> while true 
		=> if (a > b) 
		=> return (a + b)

## <a name="conditionals"></a>Conditionals
### <a name="if"></a>If Statements
In Jayfor, an if statement is denoted with the `if` keyword, a condition, and a pair of
curly `{}` braces. Within the braces, a list of statements are specified, which will execute
if the aforementioned condition is true:

	if condition {

	}

#### Null Checking
You can also use the ? operator to null check objects, like so:

	if ?condition {
		// this only executed if condition is not null
	}

As opposed to the typical

	if condition != null {

	}

### <a name="while"></a>While Loops
While Loops are specified with the `while` keyword, a condition and a pair of curly `{}` braces.
Within the braces are a list of statements, which will execute if the aforementioned condition
is true.

	while condition {

	}

### <a name="do"></a>Do While Loops
Do-While loops have been simplified to a single keyword, while it is not as semantic as the
traditional do while loop, it is consistent, and a lot easier to type. A do-while loop is
specified with the `do` keyword, a condition and a pair of curly `{}` braces:

	do condition {

	}

The statements within the curly braces (block) will be executed at least once, and will continue
executing if the condition is true (and stays true).

### <a name="loop"></a>Infinite Loops
A loop is syntactic sugar for a while loop, it will keep executing the given statements until
the loop is broken out of with the `break` keyword. A loop is specified with the `loop` keyword,
and a pair of curly `{}` braces:

	loop {

	}

### <a name="for"></a>For Loops
todo, write about inferred type for the for loop
and how .. is exclusive and ... is inclusive only 2 parameters now.

The for loop has been simplified from its traditional syntax. A for loop is specified with the
`for` keyword, and an index to keep track of the current
iteration. If you do not care about what iteration you are on, this can be replaced with an
underscore `_`. The for loop must also be given a list of 2 - 3 parameters, the start of the loop,
the end of the loop, and the step. The loops step is how much the `index` will be incremented by
every iteration. It is an optional parameter, if no step is supplied it will default to either positive
or negative 1 -- this depends on what the step and end arguments are. Also note that there is no data
type specified. This is because data types are inferred based on the values given in the parenthesis. Here are some examples:

	for index: (0, 10, 1) {

	}

	// same as the above
	for index: (0, 10) {

	}

	// start > end, which means that step
	// wil decrement instead of increment
	for index: (10, 0) {

	}

	for _: (0, 10) {
		// we don't care about
		// the index, just loop
	}

### <a name="matches"></a>Matches
We feel that the switch syntax is tedious, ugly, and not as semantic as it could be. Therefore we implemented a Rust like match:

	int value_to_match = 23
	int value = 5
	int another_value = 23

	match value_to_match {
		value == 2 {
			// this will be skipped
		},
		another_value == 3 {
			// this is the result
		},
		this_value == true {

		},
		_ {
			// this is a "default" in case value_to_match was for example 64
		}
	}

## <a name="data_structures"></a>Data Structures
### Structs
A `struct` is a data structure defined with the keyword `struct`. Here is an
example of a struct:

	struct vector {
		float x
		float y
	}

	// structs can be defined like so
	vector vec = {
		10, 10
	}

	// which is short hand for
	vector vec
	vec.x = 10
	vec.y = 10

You can also define a struct with default values, like so:

	struct vector {
		float x = 0
		float y = 0
	}

### <a name="enumeration"></a>Enumeration
Enumerations are defined with the `enum` keyword, like so:

	enum TRAFFIC_LIGHT {
		RED,
		ORANGE,
		GREEN
	}

Every value should be separated with a comma, except for the last value. As an
enumeration is a statement.
By default, the values will always start from zero, and the next value in
the enumeration will be incremented by 1. You can also change the default value with
an equal sign, like so:

	enum TRAFFIC_LIGHT {
		RED = 10,
		ORANGE,	// 11
		GREEN	// 12
	}

	// or

	enum PET_TYPE {
		DOG = 10,
		CAT = 54,
		LIZARD = 61,
		DRAGON, // this would be 62
	}

Enumerations are accessed with the double-colon operator, similar to C++:

	PET_TYPE::DOG

You can match enumerations or use them in if statements:

	// set it to dog
	int x = PET_TYPE::DOG

	if x == PET_TYPE::DOG {
		/// do stuff
	}

	match x to PET_TYPE {
		DOG {
			// im a dog
		},
		CAT {
			// im a cat
		},
		LIZARD {
			// im a lizard
		},
		_ {
			// no idea
		}
	}
