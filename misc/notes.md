# Notes
Just random stuff I write down

## Things that annoy me when developing

* Header Files
* Checking for NULL
* Functions which have one statement taking up space
* Getters and Setters
* Pointless characters, e.g PHP's $ for variables
* Ambiguity

## Good features to adopt

* Reliability
* Debuggable
* Concise
* Consistent
* Predictable - especially with libraries
